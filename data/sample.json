        "output": "Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC), caused by a germline mutation \nin BRCA1 or BRCA2, is characterized by an increased risk for breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic \ncancer. The lifetime risk for these cancers in individuals with a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2: 40%-80% for breast cancer. 11%-40% \nfor ovarian cancer. 1%-10% for male breast cancer. Up to 39% for prostate cancer. 1%-7% for pancreatic cancer. Individuals with \nBRCA2 mutations may also be at an increased risk for melanoma. Prognosis for BRCA1/2-related cancer depends on the stage at which \nthe cancer is diagnosed; however, studies on survival have revealed conflicting results for individuals with germline BRCA1 or \nBRCA2 mutations when compared to controls.
